# SIR TP6 - Pokemon API

In order to make this work you just need to download the repo and start the "index.html" file on your web browser.
Since chrome doesn't allow CORS you may need to start the project inside a http-server with an http://localhost... But this works well without any http server on Firefox or Edge.

You can find any pokemon you want that is contained in the first pokemon generation (1-151).

This project has been made with the free pokemon api https://pokeapi.co/ .
